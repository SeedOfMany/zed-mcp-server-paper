## Paper MCP Server

This extension connects Zed to [Paper](https://paper.design)'s MCP server.

### Requirements

1. **Paper desktop app** must be running (it exposes the MCP endpoint)
2. **Node.js** must be installed (for the mcp-remote bridge)

The MCP server is exposed at `http://127.0.0.1:29979/mcp` when Paper is running.
